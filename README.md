# Data Scientist


As long as you are open to learning new things and willing to put in the effort and time, you can become a Data Scientist.

The question now is, where to start?

“The beginning is perhaps more difficult than anything else, but keep heart, it will turn out all right.” ― Vincent van Gogh

A Learning Path To Becoming a Data Scientist :)

Step 1: Revise Python Programming Concepts. Try R Programming As Well.

Step 2: An essential step to standing out as a data scientist is to interact and communicate with databases effectively. If you could design a simple database, then this will take you to the next level. To communicate with a database, you will need to speak its language. That is SQL. So, revise SQL. 

Step 3: Fun Part: Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Graph Machine Learning.
